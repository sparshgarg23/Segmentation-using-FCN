# Segmentation-using-FCN
In this project the objective was to label the pixels in such a manner so that we can make an inference as to which pixels correspond to the road
in a given image.
We used a FCN
Dependecies
TensorFlow
Python 3
Numpy
Scipy
Note that due to unavailabilty of GPU full visualisation of the results couldn't be performed.
Also we need the Kitti Road Dataset which can be found at this link http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip
then extract the dataset into the data folder.
